# Redux and Prop Passing

With Redux, you donâ€™t need to pass props down through many components (prop drilling). Any component can access or update the shared state directly from the Redux store using hooks like `useSelector` and `useDispatch`. This makes your code cleaner and easier to manage, especially in large apps.

**Summary:**

- Redux keeps all important app data in one central place (the store).
- Components can read or update this data without passing it through many layers.
- This avoids messy prop passing and makes state management predictable and centralized.
