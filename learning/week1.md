# Redux and Prop Passing

With Redux, you donâ€™t need to pass props down through many components (prop drilling). Any component can access or update the shared state directly from the Redux store using hooks like `useSelector` and `useDispatch`. This makes your code cleaner and easier to manage, especially in large apps.

**Summary:**

- Redux keeps all important app data in one central place (the store).
- Components can read or update this data without passing it through many layers.
- This avoids messy prop passing and makes state management predictable and centralized.

## Overlay Layout: relative and absolute

To create overlays (like a dark layer or centered text on top of an image), use:

This lets you stack and position elements exactly where you want inside the parent, which is essential for hero sections, modals, and custom UI layers.

## Animation with framer-motion

framer-motion lets you animate React components easily. You define animation states (like `hidden` and `visible`) and set how elements should animate between them.

**Common flow:**

- The container (e.g., `<motion.div>`) starts in a `hidden` state (like opacity: 0, y: 50).
- When it comes into view, it animates to `visible` (opacity: 1, y: 0).
- `staggerChildren` in the container's transition makes each child animate in sequence, not all at once.
- Each child (e.g., `<motion.h2>`, `<motion.div>`) uses its own variants for entrance effects (like fading in and moving up).
- The layout (CSS/grid/flex) sets the final position; the animation just moves/fades the element into place.

This creates smooth, coordinated entrance animations for sections and their content.

inset-0 is a Tailwind CSS class that sets top: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0, and left: 0 for an absolutely positioned element.
